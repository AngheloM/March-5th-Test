    <p>
      Basically Git is where you can create and store your code so that other people can contribute their ideas to it. To start you must create a repository in github.com, and clone it to you desktop using the command "git clone" in git bash, you must then paste your url for the repository you want to clone after "git clone". Congratulations you have made a repository, you must then create your index.html, app.js, and styles.css. You will have to use the command "touch" followed by the name of your file, and file type. Once you are done with the your code you must follow these 3 steps in order to save your code into github. "git add .", "git commit -m" followed by a comment of what you did, then "git push". These 3 steps take whatever you worked on, in your local computer, and uploads it to github.com, where you can use the command "git pull", to download all your work from github.com to a different computer.
